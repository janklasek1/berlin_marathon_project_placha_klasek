# Berlin marathon 2021 - results analysis
Final project of the IES Python course, which scrapes and analyses data from the 2021 Berlin Marathon.

In addition to the basic analysis of participants (by gender, age, nationality etc.), we get inspired by the paper from Berry (available here: https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-sports-analytics/jsa205) and we look whether the difference in paces at the beginning and the end of the race differ across "performance groups". In other words we try to answer the question: "Can endurance athletes keep their pace throughout the race better than the "hobby" runners?"

This project is divided into three files:

* Scraper
  - this file aims to scrape information about each runner from his/her own result page
 

* Cleaner
  - clean the data and get ready-to-use columns for the analysis

* Analyser
  - all the final analysis, both numerical and graphical will be done in this Jupyter notebook
