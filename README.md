# Berlin marathon 2021 - results analysis
Final project of the IES Python course, which scrapes and analyses data from the 2021 Berlin Marathon.

**To make all the features of the Analyser work, the notebook needs to be downloaded!!! (does not work in GitHub environment), other notebooks does not need to be run.**

In addition to the basic analysis of participants (by gender, age, nationality etc.), we get inspired by the paper from Berry (available here: https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-sports-analytics/jsa205) and we look whether the difference in paces at the beginning and the end of the race differ across "performance groups". In other words we try to answer the question: "Can endurance athletes keep their pace throughout the race better than the "hobby" runners?"

This project is divided into three files:

* Scraper
  - this file aims to scrape information about each runner from his/her own result page
 

* Cleaner
  - clean the data and get ready-to-use columns for the analysis

* Analyser
  - all the final analysis, both numerical and graphical will be done in this Jupyter notebook
