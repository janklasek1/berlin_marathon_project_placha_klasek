### Analyser

The following analysis and visualisations are done in this notebook:

- Number of finishers by several criteria: gender, age category, nationality etc.

- Finishing times by the same criteria as above.

- We get inspired by the paper from Smith (2018) read [here](https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-sports-analytics/jsa205)  and perform linear regression to find which factors influence how evenly the runners can keep the pace throughout the race.

- For each runner we prepare individualized graph of pacing throughout the whole race.


Visualisations are done using following libraries: `matplotlib`, `seaborn` and `altair`.
